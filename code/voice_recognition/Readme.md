# ML Audio Classifier Example for Pico

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/ml-audio-classifier-example-for-pico/blob/main/ml_audio_classifier_example_for_pico.ipynb)

An end-to-end flow for ML audio classification: collecting and capturing data for training, transfer learning, re-training, deploying to a [Raspberry Pi RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/rp2040/) based device using Google Colab.

For an overview of the flow, see the ["End-to-end tinyML audio classification with the Raspberry Pi RP2040" guest blog post on the TensorFlow blog.](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/09/TinyML-Audio-for-everyone.html)
